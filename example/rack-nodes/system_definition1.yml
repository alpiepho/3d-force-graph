### Define system topology which consists of a list of all chassis with its downstream connections.
### Except for single-chassis systems, do not list chassis without downstream connections.
### All chassis/downstream connection together must result in a fully connected chassis topology
### To identify the chassis can use TSE or TSE-TCP Resource IDs, and for local chassis can also use VISA Resource ID
topology:
  - chassis: tse-tcp://localhost:8674/PXI0::1::BACKPLANE
    downstream:
      - 2: tse-tcp://5cg2145s3x.internal:8674/PXI0::1::BACKPLANE
  - chassis: tse-tcp://localhost:8674/PXI0::3::BACKPLANE
    downstream:
      - 1: tse-tcp://localhost:8674/PXI0::2::BACKPLANE
  - chassis: tse-tcp://5cg2145s3x.internal:8674/PXI0::1::BACKPLANE
    downstream:
      - 1: tse-tcp://5cg2145s3x.internal:8674/PXI0::2::BACKPLANE
      - 2: tse-tcp://5cg2145s3x.internal:8674/PXI0::3::BACKPLANE


### [OPTIONAL] When enabled, it allows the client applications to use a subset of the system topology. By default, it is true.

# Configure clocking

# If this section is not included TSE will assume Cellini-Internal for multi-chassis and
clocking:
  reference:  hpc # Allowed values are: ssm|chassis|hpc. Default is: ssm.
                # We can assume the chassis and ssm to be the leader defined in the connections earlier
  mode: internal # Allowed values are:  internal|external. Default is: internal.
  # frequency: 10e6 # Allowed only with mode == external

 
   # [OPTIONAL]
