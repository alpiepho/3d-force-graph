# rack-nodes

This was leverage from the html-nodes example.  The make_data.js file
was added to generate nodes and links for the Quads racks based on rack1000.txt.  Later we will add a configuration for rack16x6.txt (sorry, those files are not included, just know these are two configurations for the Quads systems)
